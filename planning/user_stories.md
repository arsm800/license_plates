All users should be able to view all locations and license plates.  (read-only)

Only one user (me) is able to add new license plates, modify information of existing license plates or delete existing license plates.

The user has the option to search for license plates by location or by plate number.

For each location clicked on by user, an ordered list of license plates and their photograph appears on the page.  Each plate has a link the user can click on to go that individual plate's home page.

Each license plate home page has a photograph of the license plate as well as its attributes (year, number, style, source, and date acquired) organized in an ordered list.

If I am the user, "add", "modify", and "remove" buttons appear on the homepage.

The "add" link sends the user to a form where attributes and a photograph of the license plate are added and submitted.

The "modify" link sends the user to a form where attributes and/or a photograph of the license plate are updated.

The "remove" button sends the user to a page where they can select from a list the plates they wish to delete.
